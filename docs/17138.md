Did you build React app and want to deploy it, following these simple steps you able to deploy and showing the world your amazing app.

I will show how to create and deploy React App using [`create-react-app`](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) and [GitHub Pages](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gh-pages)

**Prerequisites** :

*   [GitHub](https://github.com/join) Account.

*   Install [Git](https://git-scm.com/) in your machine and [Set up Git](https://help.github.com/en/articles/set-up-git).

*Make sure you have Node.js and Npm installed in your machine.*

*   Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)

*   Install [Npm](https://nodejs.org/en/)

**Notice** You’ll need to have Node 8.10.0 or later on your local machine.

**Procedure** :

1- First create a repository named `my-app` using [`create-react-app`](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

`npm init react-app my-app`

2- We need to install [GitHub Pages](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gh-pages) package as a dev-dependency.

`cd my-app`
`npm install gh-pages --save-dev`

3- Add properties to `package.json` file.

The first property we need to add at the top level `homepage` second we will define this as a string and the value will be `"http://{username}.github.io/{repo-name}"` {username} is your GitHub username, and {repo-name} is the name of the GitHub repository you created it will look like this :

`"homepage": "http://yuribenjamin.github.io/my-app"`

Second in the existing `scripts` property we to need to add `predeploy` and `deploy`.

`"scripts": {
//...
"predeploy": "npm run build",
"deploy": "gh-pages -d build"
}`

4- Create a Github repository and initialize it and add it as a remote in your local git repository.

Now, create a remote GitHub repository with your app name and go back initialize this
`git init`
add it as remote
`git remote add origin git@github.com:Yuribenjamin/my-app.git`

5- Now deploy it to GitHub Pages.

just run the following command :

`npm run deploy`

this command will create a branch named `gh-pages` this branch host your app, and homepage property you created in `package.json` file hold your link for a live preview, or you can open the branch setting scroll down to GitHub Pages section you will find this:

6- commit and push your commit to GitHub. *Optionally*

`git add .`
`git commit -m "Your awesome message"`
`git push origin master`

**Recap**

We created React App using `create-react-app`
then we installed `gh-pages` as a dev-dependency
and in `package.json` file we added some properties `homepage` also in existing `scripts` property we added `predeploy` and `deploy`
and created a remote repository and initialize it
and run `npm run deploy` to generate a production build and deploy it to GitHub Pages.
